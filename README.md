This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripts when handling filenames containing spaces or special characters.  The script `bug.sh` attempts to process `.txt` files in the current directory, but fails to correctly handle filenames with spaces or special characters. The `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version that uses safer techniques to avoid this problem.  This is a critical issue as it can lead to data loss or incomplete processing.
