# This script attempts to process files in a directory,
# but it has a subtle error that can lead to unexpected behavior.

# The goal is to process only files (not directories) ending with ".txt"

  echo "Processing: $file"
  # Some processing of the file would go here...
  # However, there's a crucial error that can manifest when a file
  # name contains spaces or special characters
  # For instance, a file named "My Document.txt" might not be handled correctly
  # because the while loop might not parse the file name correctly in case there are spaces
  # A file name with special characters could also cause the same kind of issues

  # This is a serious error because the script would ignore such files
  # leaving some files unprocessed
